# ADR-001: Architecture Refactoring to Layered Structure

## Status

**Accepted** - Implemented on 2025-07-31

## Context

The Moura.ar v3 project initially used a simple folder structure with mixed concerns:

```
src/
├── utils/           # Mixed utilities (client, server, security)
├── infrastructure/ # Cache and logging utilities
├── services/       # Single service container interface
└── components/     # UI components
```

This structure had several issues:

- **Mixed Abstraction Levels**: Infrastructure and utilities contained different types of functionality
- **Poor Separation of Concerns**: Client-side and server-side utilities were mixed
- **Unclear Dependencies**: No clear dependency flow between layers
- **Difficult Maintenance**: Hard to locate specific functionality
- **Testing Challenges**: Difficult to test layers in isolation

## Decision

We decided to refactor the architecture to a **layered structure** with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── lib/         # 🆕 Core reusable libraries
├── services/    # 🆕 Business logic services
├── core/        # 🆕 Application foundation
├── components/  # UI components (unchanged)
├── pages/       # Routes & API (unchanged)
└── ...         # Other directories (unchanged)
```

### Key Changes

1. **Created `lib/` Directory**:

   - Moved `infrastructure/cache/` → `lib/cache/`
   - Moved `infrastructure/logging/` → `lib/logger/`
   - Moved `utils/security.ts` → `lib/security/`
   - Moved `utils/jwt.ts` → `lib/security/`
   - Moved `utils/analytics/*` → `lib/analytics/`
   - Moved `utils/textParser.ts` → `lib/validation/`

2. **Created `services/` Directory**:

   - Moved `utils/contact-form-client.ts` → `services/contact/`
   - Created structure for analytics and content services

3. **Created `core/` Directory**:

   - Moved `services/base/ServiceContainer.ts` → `core/container/`
   - Created structure for config and core types

4. **Updated Path Aliases**:

   - Added `@lib/*` → `src/lib/*`
   - Added `@services/*` → `src/services/*`
   - Added `@core/*` → `src/core/*`

5. **Updated All Imports**:
   - Converted 11 files to use new path aliases
   - Eliminated all legacy import paths
   - Updated both `tsconfig.json` and `vitest.config.ts`

## Rationale

### Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:

   - **lib/**: Pure utilities and technical capabilities
   - **services/**: Business logic and domain operations
   - **core/**: Application-wide configuration and foundation

2. **Better Dependency Management**:

   - Components can import from lib, services, core
   - Services can import from lib, core
   - Libraries can only import from other lib modules
   - Core has minimal dependencies

3. **Improved Maintainability**:

   - Logical grouping of related functionality
   - Easier to locate specific features
   - Clear boundaries between layers

4. **Enhanced Testability**:

   - Each layer can be tested in isolation
   - Clear interfaces between layers
   - Easier to mock dependencies

5. **Scalability**:
   - New features can be added to appropriate layers
   - Clean extension points for future functionality
   - Supports growth without architectural debt

## Implementation Details

### Migration Process

1. **Created New Directory Structure**: Used `mkdir -p` to create new folders
2. **Moved Files Systematically**: Used `mv` commands to relocate files to new structure
3. **Updated Configurations**: Modified `tsconfig.json` and `vitest.config.ts` with new aliases
4. **Updated All Imports**: Systematically updated 11 files with new import paths
5. **Validated Migration**: Ran tests, build, and type checking to ensure no breaking changes

### Path Alias Strategy

```typescript
// tsconfig.json
{
  "@lib/*": ["src/lib/*"],           // Libraries and utilities
  "@services/*": ["src/services/*"], // Business logic services
  "@core/*": ["src/core/*"]          // Application foundation
}
```

### Import Conventions

```typescript
// Layer-aware imports (preferred order)
import type { Config } from '@core/types/config'; // Core first
import { logger } from '@lib/logger/Logger'; // Libraries second
import { contactService } from '@services/contact/api'; // Services third
import ContactForm from '@components/ui/ContactForm.astro'; // Components last
```

## Validation Results

### ✅ Testing Validation

- **Unit Tests**: All 15 security tests passing
- **Build Process**: Successful compilation (9.75s total)
- **Type Checking**: Import resolution working correctly
- **Coverage**: 24.89% coverage on actively tested security module

### ✅ File Structure Validation

- **All Files Moved**: 9/9 files successfully relocated
- **Old Directories Removed**: `/utils`, `/infrastructure`, `/services/base` cleaned up
- **New Structure Created**: `/lib`, `/services`, `/core` established

### ✅ Import Migration Success

- **11 files** now using new `@lib/*` imports
- **4 files** using `@services/*` imports
- **1 file** using `@core/*` imports
- **0 remaining** legacy import paths

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. **Feature-Based Structure**

```
src/
├── contact/     # All contact-related code
├── analytics/   # All analytics code
└── security/    # All security code
```

**Rejected**: Would mix UI and business logic in same folders

### 2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

```
src/
├── domains/
│   ├── contact/
│   ├── analytics/
│   └── portfolio/
```

**Rejected**: Too complex for current project size

### 3. **Keep Current Structure**

**Rejected**: Technical debt was accumulating and maintainability was decreasing

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **✅ Improved Code Organization**: Clear, logical structure
2. **✅ Better Developer Experience**: Easy to find and modify code
3. **✅ Enhanced Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities
4. **✅ Future-Proof**: Scalable architecture for growth
5. **✅ Zero Breaking Changes**: All functionality preserved

### Potential Negative Consequences

1. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn new structure
   - _Mitigation_: Comprehensive documentation and clear conventions
2. **Initial Migration Effort**: One-time refactoring cost
   - _Mitigation_: Completed successfully with full validation
3. **Path Changes**: Import paths changed across project
   - _Mitigation_: Path aliases make imports cleaner and more intuitive

## Follow-up Actions

1. **✅ Update Documentation**: Architecture and conventions documented
2. **✅ Create Migration Guide**: Step-by-step refactoring documentation
3. **⏳ Expand Testing**: Add unit tests for new lib/ modules
4. **⏳ Team Training**: Ensure all developers understand new structure
5. **⏳ Monitor Usage**: Track how well new structure works in practice
